# TIIKA, a website by Benjamin Smith

This repository holds all of the generated static site files for the website tiika.co (not yet live). These files are being generated using a series of python scripts that reside in this [repository](https://github.com/bensmith-314/static-site-tiika). As of now this project is ongoing and needs a lot of work.
