# Everyday Artwork

***

Here is a reverse chronological selection of all the everyday artwork I've created. Everyday since March 22, 2021 I've started and finished a digital art piece. I initially started creating digital artwork in December of 2020 out of boredom and eventually wanted to try my hand at the everyday challenge after coming across [Beeble](https://www.beeple-crap.com/everydays). There have been many points across this project that I've considered being done and stepping away from it. But looking back, I am glad that I've stuck with it. 

Check back tomorrow for something new!
